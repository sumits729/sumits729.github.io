In rural areas or in farmers market, small farmers sell their produce to wholesalers or customers and payment is based on weight of box of fruits or vegetables. Weight needs to be checked and payment is done accordingly. Payment is done offline and people often do mistakes in manually checking weights or sometimes wholesalers do fraud in weight and give farmers less payment especially in African or Asian countries. We have developed smart iot weight machine and website that farmers can put weight of produce and payment is calculated and saved to customers account on website. Farmers can do payment online using square terminal api and also get all details of each box and its price, thus reducing manual work and reducing fraud. ESP32 is used to connect normal weight machine to internet using wifi and all payment records are stored in website database. Also we have used Google Ai that checks unripe mangoes and adjusts price of box accordingly. Unripe mangoes are counted and so farmer can get transparent pricing and no manual error or fraud is done as some wholesalers count less ripe mangoes than usual and give less money to farmers. Also website account stores Ai photos for record. Esp32 camera is used to take photo. Currently we have made AI software only for mango and will add other fruits and vegetables.  We have Credit card Problem in registering with Google cloud so we developed application in docker wrapper with Tensorlfow libraries that can be installed in google cloud
